<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:times new roman;">Introduction of School of Economics and Management</span></strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:times new roman;">The School of Economics and Management, Southeast &nbsp;University was established in August 1987. Now the School has eight &nbsp;academic departments, and they are: Department of Management Science and &nbsp;Engineering, Department of International Economics and Trade, &nbsp;Department of Business Administration, Department of Finance, Department &nbsp;of Accounting, Department of Economics, Department of E-Business, and &nbsp;Department of Logistic Management Engineering. The School offers two &nbsp;Ph.D programs including Management Science &amp; Engineering and Systems &nbsp;Engineering together with the respective two post-doctoral programs. &nbsp;The School offers thirteen master’s degree programs including Management &nbsp;Science and Engineering, Systems Management, Systematical Analysis and &nbsp;Integration, International Economics and Business, Industrial Economics, &nbsp;Finance, Regional Economics, National Economics, Business &nbsp;Administration, Technical Economics and Management, Accounting, public &nbsp;administration and MBA. Also, the School offers eight undergraduate &nbsp;programs including Information Management and Information Systems, &nbsp;International Economics and Business, Business Administration, &nbsp;Accounting, Finance, Economics Electronic Business and Logistic &nbsp;Management. Now, the School is staffed with about 140 full-time faculty &nbsp;members, among whom are 30 full professors and nearly 40 associate &nbsp;professors. The School has total enrollment of more than 1,300 &nbsp;undergraduate students, 579 M.S students, 203 doctoral students, and &nbsp;about 600 MBA students. Now, the Dean of the School is Professor Xu &nbsp;Kangning.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:times new roman;">The School of Economics and Management has an excellent faculty, modern &nbsp;teaching facilities and fine education traditions. Most of the teachers &nbsp;have a Ph.D or a master’s degree in relevant field. Many of them are not &nbsp;only good teachers who have solid theoretic basis but also experienced &nbsp;practitioners. They are increasingly aware of the importance of &nbsp;understanding the linkages between their research and the current &nbsp;situations of the country and some enterprises. They can combine &nbsp;theories with practice in the process of their teaching and always &nbsp;pursue both domestic and foreign academic frontiers. The School has a &nbsp;good tradition of maintaining active course development, attaching great &nbsp;importance in culturing students in all aspects, fostering pedagogical &nbsp;experimentation. In addition, the School offers an integrated array of &nbsp;electives that build on the 14 core courses for all undergraduate &nbsp;students of the School, thus the students that graduated from the School &nbsp;can adapt themselves to circumstances quickly because of the solid &nbsp;theoretic background, strong analytic abilities and a wide field of &nbsp;vision that they attain here. Students of the School ranked No.1 both in &nbsp;the National “Challenge Cup” Business Planning Competition and in the &nbsp;National MBA Management Contest. Many undergraduate students enter for &nbsp;the examination for graduate admission. Those who look for their jobs &nbsp;are welcomed by employers and 98% of them can find their job in one &nbsp;attempt. In addition, the School has enjoyed good cooperation relations &nbsp;with some business schools in USA, Australia, France, Germany, Korea, &nbsp;Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc. in many fields such as students/faculty exchange &nbsp;programs and joint scientific researches.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:times new roman;">The School of Economics and Management is always &nbsp;placing academic&nbsp; construction in an important position and, in the &nbsp;meantime, driving the development of culturing students and scientific &nbsp;research. With the efforts for many years, the School of Economics and &nbsp;Management has grown up into a school covering Economics, Management, &nbsp;and Engineering with a complete and reasonable department structure and &nbsp;has formed its own department features and competitive&nbsp; advantages.&nbsp; As &nbsp;to scientific research, the school is committed to serving the&nbsp; economic &nbsp;construction and aiming at solving the practical problems of the &nbsp;enterprises from all over the country during their economic development &nbsp;and operational management. Some research projects of the School such as &nbsp;CIMS Project of&nbsp; Beijing No.1 Machine Tool Plant, Research on the &nbsp;Technical Competence of Cities and Counties in China, Comparative &nbsp;research on the Competitiveness of&nbsp; Chinese Cities, and Research into &nbsp;Metropolitan Areas in East China and the World Manufacturing Base, &nbsp;Overall Planning of Logistic System of China Petroleum &amp; Chemical &nbsp;Corporation (Sinopec) have made strong influences in the whole country. &nbsp;In resent years, the School has presided lots of research projects &nbsp;subsidized by National Natural Science Foundation of China, National &nbsp;Social Science Foundation of China, Ministry of Education of China, &nbsp;Ministry of Science and Technology of China and Jiangsu Province and has &nbsp;made fruitful research results of high academic level, which represent &nbsp;the frontier and directions of academic study.</span></p>
